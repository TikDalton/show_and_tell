        Getting used to the basics of the command line is somewhat essential to everything else. I've been told we can do pretty much absolutely anything from the command line, but I'm certainly not at that stage - and even illustrious programmers who have a decade of experience have a cheat sheet (I've seen it with mine own jellied orbs). <br>
        So what do I know?
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li> How to use the terminal to create files and directories
          </li>
          <li>How to move around those files and directories</li>
          <li>How to delete/alter files and directories</li>
          <li>How to find out about different commands (man pages)</li>
          <li>How to download files (curl) from the webs</li>
          <li>Running GREP and the like</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Things that I very much need to keep going over because they haven't quite sunk in...
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Piping things <code>|</code> (less/more, other abstractions...)</li>
          <li>Running <code>grep</code> searches, they are <strong>pesky</strong>, and I haven't used it enough to be comfortable</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        I mean, in general I'm very comfortable using the command line for basic git use - and I think that's because it is what I've used it for most.<br>
        Actions going forward are to try and actively move around and use the command line to further my comfortability with it. This will likely be done as I move along the <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/course/ruby_on_rails_tutorial_4th_edition/beginning" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Something I very much do enjoy about the command line is the ability to make it look like I'm in the playground of the matrix, and people look at me like I'm a wizard on the bus...
