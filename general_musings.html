          This is simply the space where my garbled mind can unravel my very generic thoughts about what I'm doing, how I'm <em>feeling</em> about that, etc. In a way, this exercise has been hard, because I want to be better, I want to have all the skills, preferably <strong>yesterday</strong>. But that's not possible, so I trundle along, doing the most I can. And I suppose for now, that's good enough.
        </p>
        <p>So this is how I started:</p>
        <img src="images/no_idea.jpg" alt="Cute Doggo">
        <p>And it is frequently how I feel.</p>
        <p>
          The good thing, is that I'm starting to be able to fix things on my own. There are moments where I flail and piteously whine at the Internet or Andy for help, but for the most part, I get by with a little help from my <em>technical sophistication</em>.<br>

          Direct quote from my 'The Fuck Am I Doing' collection of notes:
          <blockquote>
            I mean, in general it seems fairly weird to type it all out because I’ve come out of the other end of it just like - ye I can use the terminal to push around and make files and open up some of my files in atom and then push them to a remote repository, and what?<br>
            It simultaneously feels like I haven’t learned much, and that I’ve learned a lot. It’s very basic stuff, I can’t move heaven and earth — but I’ve become quite comfortable using the programmes, routinely committing changes via terminal, that sort of thing.<br>
            It’s very satisfying building the website, particularly when I’m viewing it building as it goes along through Atom.
          </blockquote>
        </p>

          And yeah, for now I'm pinching CSS templates and whatnot, but I'm confident in picking things apart and playing with them till they fit. Same goes for the command line, git and text editors, play around until I feel comfortable. The world won't end if I bugger up a few things here and there.<br>
          I'm very much looking forward to getting stuck into the Rails tutorial and seeing what can be done with it.
